# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[Summary Info](./summary_info.R) | Has summary information used in our dynamic paragraph
|[Summary Table](./summary_table.R) | Has code for summary table
|[Chart 1](./chart_1.R) | Has code for chart 1
|[Chart 2](./chart_2.R) | Has code for chart 2
|[Chart 3](./chart_3.R) | Has code for chart 3



# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ...
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them in the table above
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore,
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete this NOTE sections (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
