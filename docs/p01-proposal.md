## Abstract

Our main concern is with the outrageous amount of instances of police misconduct and the high amount of settlement paid for these misconducts. This is important because no one wants to be a victim of police misconduct, but it does exist, so we need to have a discussion about instances that do occur. We plan to highlight these cases to not only educate but to research law enforcement policies that will decrease the number of police misconducts.

## Introduction

Police have always been at the center of a lot of issues in the United States. They tend to abuse the power that they hold over citizens which lets them believe that their actions are justified and reasonable. From unexplained and unjustified killings, arrests, profiling, violence, etc. They always seem to not be held accountable for their actions and there is often no justice that is served. However, for this project, we will be focusing on police that is held accountable for their misconduct and the settlements that they make to the victims and/or their families in major cities in the United States. This will include the specific misconducts that happen and the settlements that go along with them. We will also focus on how we can reduce police misconduct and understand why it happens starting off with specific cases in major cities across America.


## Problem Domain

#### **Background**
Over the years, many police departments in major cities in the United States have spent hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on police misconduct settlements. But first, what exactly is determined as police misconduct? Police misconduct can be defined as law enforcement committing illegal and unethical acts on official duty. According to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), police misconduct can be included in “both *criminal* and *civil* statutes” (Civil Rights Division, 2020, para. 2).

**Criminal:** In civil statutes, in the case of police misconduct, the case is brought against the government department or agency, evidence only needs to satisfy the “preponderance of the evidence,” and the outcome is police enforcement policy changes and possible settlement for the victim (Civil Rights Division, 2020, para. 5).

**Civil:** In civil statutes, in the case of police misconduct, the case is brought against the government department or agency, evidence only needs to satisfy the “preponderance of the evidence,” and the outcome is police enforcement policy changes and possible settlement for the victim (Civil Rights Division, 2020, para. 5).

#### **Human values**

It is important to recognize the lives and experiences of victims of police misconduct. Police brutality, the ultimate form of police misconduct, has a racial disproportion against Black Americans. Black men are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by law enforcement compared to their white counterparts (Edwards, 2019, p. 16794). It is necessary to protest against the racial injustices Americans face from the very entity, law enforcement, meant to protect them.

#### **Stakeholders**

Direct stakeholders of this data include: law enforcement personnel, government officials, and news journalists. Law enforcement is a direct stakeholder because the entire dataset is based upon their ability to do their job. They can reflect on this information and be more aware of the scenarios that may occur in their line of work. Journalists, specifically those who specialize in justice and social issues, are also direct stakeholders because they are able to utilize their resources and skills to publicize stories of police misconduct. An indirect stakeholder would be Americans who read the articles written by those journalists and those who pay government taxes that law enforcement agencies use to pay settlements for victims.

#### **Benefits & Harms**

A possible result of this data could be a type of police reform. An example of this is the “Defund the Police” movement, which fights for the relocation of police funds, and to turn to alternative policing services (“Alternatives to police services,” 2020). This conversation often strikes up debate about whether or not defunding the police is beneficial or not. The root and common denominator of all police misconduct are well, police. Abolishing the police systems will certainly decrease the number of police misconduct. However, there are possible harms and tradeoffs. It has been debated that abolishing the police will turn the nation into the “Purge,” a dystopian society where all crimes are decriminalized for twelve hours. It has also been argued the police are frequently called for a wide variety of reasons such as traffic disputes, everyday issues, suspicious behavior, etc (Lum et al., 2021, p. 271).

## Research Questions
1. **Question:** What is the typical occurrence/frequency of police misconduct in the US?

  **Importance:** As police misconduct involves police officers who are supposed to be under the law at any given time, it is important to know just how much police misconduct goes on within the police forces of the U.S. Knowing its frequency will help figure out how prominent of a problem this is.

2. **Question:** How many police officers in the US have been involved in police misconduct?

  **Importance:** Knowing how many police officers have been involved with misconduct helps pinpoint the number of people actually involved in corrupt behavior within the police systems of the United States. Furthermore, this question can also reveal which police systems throughout the U.S. have more cases of police misconduct than others, and that can lead to the question of why police misconduct happens more in some places.

3. **Question:** What kinds of cases are usually involved with police misconduct?

  **Importance:** This question gives more insight into how exactly police officers within the United States are using their power. This could be through excessive force, sexual assault, fraud, forceful confessions, and more. Overall, we need to know more about the areas in which police abuse or exercise their power.

4. **Question:** What are some results of police misconduct cases?

  **Importance:** After finding out what examples of police misconduct occur throughout the country, the next thing to find out is what happens as a result of these cases. This question may be hard to answer, as not every case of police misconduct goes noticed, however, knowing what happens to cases that do go noticed is important to observe. Researching this question will reveal whether or not police officers are held accountable, or even if they are held accountable as equally as others.

5. **Question:** Is the reason for large amounts of money being paid for settlements because
there are many occurrences of police misconduct or are settlement checks big?

  **Importance:** This question explores the amount of funding that goes toward the police systems of the United States. It serves to question why exactly police funding is so huge, and what it does for police officers. Knowing this can possibly uncover even more abuse of power if police funding helps out police officers who are under investigation for police misconduct.

## Datasets

The first dataset shows a list of police misconduct cases all throughout the United States. It gives the names of the police officers involved in the cases, as well as what the case was and more. This dataset can help answer the question of how many officers are involved in police misconduct cases, and what kind of cases usually come from police misconduct. The second and third dataset also lists the different police misconduct cases but on a city level. The dataset is grouped by many big cities in the country, showing a more focused view on police misconduct. It also shows the amount awarded to those who were affected in the form of police settlements. These numbers can reveal results from cases of police misconduct where settlements were successfully made and can show how direct stakeholders were impacted by the police misconduct cases.

**a)** The first dataset in the dataset links was created by the USC Safe Communities Institute (SCI). The institute made the Police Misconduct Registry in hopes of increasing transparency within police departments across the country and also improving policies within the police force through learning from the dataset. The dataset is updated frequently and was last updated on October 25th, 2022. The other datasets were created by Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, Laura Bronner, and Damini Sharma. Published on 2/22/22, the datasets go in depth about the increase of police settlements for misconduct within the last few years. It explores why that could be possible by acknowledging different possibilities that are all worth thinking about, such as “are police misconduct cases happening more?” and “are people coming out with police misconduct stories to cause the increase in settlements?”

**b)** The SCI is funded by the college, and its history was in 1946 when juvenile delinquency was a high concern for citizens and social workers. The institute exists to serve as a resource that raises awareness for people with concerns about the public. The data help benefits those who want to know more about police misconduct as a public health concern. The other sources were funded by the Marshall Project, which is a nonprofit organization in the U.S. that focuses on the criminal justice system. Here, the data benefits not only those who want to know more about police misconduct and its settlements, but also communities that have been affected by police misconduct. This sort of transparency is important for those affected by police misconduct, as it shows the real weight of the issue.

**c)** The SCI’s database on police misconduct collects its data often from news articles created by local news sources, or even bigger news sources like CNN or NBC. It also collects data from government websites for states. Although this method of data collection may not be the most accurate or consistent, it still is a valuable source for getting an idea of how often police misconduct occurs. The other sources took its data from city governments themselves. The authors asked city governments for data, and only some agreed to do so. Although this limits the sources’ findings, as not all cities are included in the dataset, it is definitely credible and trustworthy.

**d)** The datasets on police settlements were found on the dataset website, “FiveThirtyEight,” and the SCI dataset was found by searching the internet for data on police misconduct. We find all of our sources to be useful in our research, as the content is valuable and important to create a conversation around police misconduct and its abusive behaviors. All our sources are listed below.

## Expected Implications

There are many expected learning outcomes and observations one can take away from our project and research questions. One expected implication for this project would be that the more serious the misconduct is (for example a wrongful and unreasonable killing, a civil rights violation, or a wrongful arrest) the settlement would be a lot higher compared to smaller misconduct. Another expected implication would be that the most common form of police misconduct is false imprisonment. There are many cases of false imprisonment that I hear about all over the internet/media. Stakeholders for both implications would be citizens in general in the United States because they could be a victim of police misconduct at any time due to profiling or any other circumstances.

## Limitations

One limitation that we might need to address would be how we don't know all of the cases of police misconduct for some of the rows in the dataset. For example, there is a “summary allegations” column and for some of the rows, it says “other” instead of the actual allegation. There are settlement amounts that are assigned to each one so you just have to predict what the allegation could be. Another limitation would be how the allegations are pretty vague. There are a lot of “civil rights violations” but they vary in settlement amount a lot so you can’t tell which right was violated and connect it to the money they received. I know that all rights shouldn’t be violated however when it comes to police there is a lot that is considered very serious especially if they are violated by them. So a way to address this would be by searching which amendments would qualify as more serious like the fourth amendment and connecting it to the settlement.
