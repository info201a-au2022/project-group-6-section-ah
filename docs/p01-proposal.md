## Introduction
Poverty is a huge issue seen all over the United States. It is a real problem that affects many aspects of their daily lives, including housing, employment, mental health, etc. For this project, we will be focusing on how poverty affects physical health in relation to food insecurities, as well as in relation to health concerns such as diabetes or cardiovascular diseases. We will be exploring this issue and work towards understanding the complexities of poverty and how it affects peopleâ€™s health and well-being. Furthermore, poverty is prone to be a topic that is often disregarded by those who are privileged enough to not be affected by it, making this research important to acknowledge when working to aid families in poverty.
